# cpp-animation-lib
A ready to use animations utility library made for C++

# Example
with this example we are going to use [ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) to do a fading animation for the back-ground <br> <br>
Were gonna start with initilizing the <strong>_Animation_</strong> class
```cpp
Animation anmFade;
```
you can aslo choose the properties you want for the animation like in this example
```cpp
// Set the animation duration you want in seconds
Animation anmFade(2.5f); // args: float AnimDuration

// or also choose the easing functions you want to use
Animation anmFade(2.5f, EaseInCirc, EaseOutCirc);
// args: float AnimDuration, easing_functions In, easing_functions out
// Note: EaseInQuad, EaseOutQuad will be the default functions used if not specfied
```
Then now, we have to constantly update it by calling the <strong>_Update_</strong> function inside your main loop
```cpp
anmFade.Update();
```
Then now, to retrieve the value of the current animation, use the function <strong>_getValue_</strong>
```cpp
// Will return a value from 0.0 -> 1.0
float AlphaValue = anmFade.getValue()

// or do this to apply the animation to a certian base value
// here for example if the fade value is 0.65, and we just want to animate it creating fade-in and out affects, add a paramater inside of getValue like this
float AlphaValue = anmFade.getValue(0.65f); // This will just multiply the value by the value given
// args: float | int baseValue
```
Thats it for getting the value of the animation and updating it!<br><br>
but what about switching from fade-in or out, to do that we'll use the <strong>_Switch_</strong> function, or <strong>_getSwitch_</strong> based on what we're doing, and like said we'll be using [ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) for our example here
```cpp
// All of the steps that we've already done
static Animation anmFade(1.5f, EaseInCubic, EaseOutSine);
anmFade.Update();

float AlphaValue = anmFade.getValue(0.65f);
ImColor col = ImVec4(0.f, 0.f, 0.f, AlphaValue);
ImGui::GetBackgroundDrawList()->AddRectFilled(ImVec2(0, 0), ImGui::GetIO()DisplaySize, col);
    
// How to use the switch for a button
if (ImGui::Button("Button Switch!"))
    anmFade.Switch(); // Will switch between ease/fade-in and out

// Or for checkboxes, were gonna have to use the "getSwtich" function
ImGui::Checkbox("Button Switch!", &anmFade.getSwitch());
```
Voil√†!<br>
the code above will result in a working fade-in and out back-ground easily!<br>
you can use this for basically everything in your code that you want to animate or transition any value smoothly really
***
Another great example is creating a <strong>_pop-up window_</strong>! To demonstrate this, I will also be using [ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui). Although all the steps are the same, I will also provide the Class Properties and the necessary math calculations specifically for the proof of concept. This will allow you to try it out, understand the code better, and become more familiar with using the library.

```cpp
// the Properties for a proper pop-up animation 
Animation anim(0.5f, EaseOutBack, EaseOutSine);

// the math calculations for the size, and position
int width = 400, height = 200;
auto Size = ImVec2(anim.getValue(width), anim.getValue(height));
auto Pos = ImVec2((ImGui::GetIO().DisplaySize - Size) / 2);

// This is only because ImGui limits window sizes, and wont go to 0
if (anim.getValue() > 0.1f)
{
    ImGui::SetNextWindowPos(Pos);
    ImGui::SetNextWindowSize(Size);
    ImGui::Begin("Popup Window");
    ImGui::End();
}
```
Try this out for yourself and see the results!
you can play around with this as much as you want and just go crazy with it.<br>
<strong>Have fun!</strong>
